00:01:24:2 pA seems impossible
00:03:13:4 Gonna read pB
00:07:04:6 pB also seems impossible
00:08:34:9 How tf did people already solve pA?
00:16:19:1 Try binary search?
00:18:28:0 Hmm I don't have a proof for this, I'll still code it anyways
00:22:09:5 AC pA?
00:22:11:6 Somehow nobody solved pB yet
00:22:18:5 Reading pC
00:24:54:5 I have nothing to do, maybe I should write brute force pC's small subtask?
00:26:05:2 The math for 3d geometry in pC is still hard :(
00:31:25:4 Ok I found the equation for a plane given 3 points, gonna start coding pC
00:43:21:0 Finished coding, gonna check now
00:44:05:2 Hmm how do I know my answer is right, not like I can draw 3d stuff out
00:46:03:1 There seems to be weird bugs
00:49:19:6 Oops I forgot to apply permutations when checking, so only the identity permutation was checked
00:51:09:7 Still more bugs?
01:06:00:1 Finally passes the sample tests, I forgot a negative sign in the stupid math formulas
01:08:34:4 Not completely tested, but I'm too lazy to test by myself
01:09:40:4 AC pC's small subtask
01:12:48:9 Hmm maybe pB is possible by generating random graphs and testing them with matrix exponentiation
01:49:39:5 Submitting for l=10
01:50:28:4 Ooh AC pB's small subtask
01:54:35:1 I got all the graphs that I need generated
01:54:46:3 Submitting it, testing with l=50 now
01:54:52:4 Compile error :(
01:55:14:9 Rip code too large
01:59:21:7 Still compile error, isn't the source file limit for GCJ like 1mb?
02:03:37:3 Now generating graphs within the code, not hard-coding them
02:04:29:8 AC pB?
02:04:31:6 Reading pD
02:09:24:3 pD is too weird, gonna give up
+8 minutes of penalty because of 2 compile errors
The compile error is actually Java's fault, not GCJ's
