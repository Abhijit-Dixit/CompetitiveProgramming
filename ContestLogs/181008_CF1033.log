00:11:11:9 Submitted pC
00:28:43:4 pD sample bugs :(
00:36:52:9 Submitting pD
00:36:58:5 CE
00:37:19:2 Resubmitted
00:37:30:0 AC pD?
00:37:35:7 Reading pE
00:42:25:3 Reading pF
00:46:21:7 Reading pG
00:47:39:6 pG is not grundy, or is it?
00:51:12:5 For each node, find an outward edge
00:51:16:3 Build connected graph
00:51:33:0 Test the partitions
00:51:38:8 What if they don't work?
00:51:49:7 How to find the odd cycle?
00:52:50:7 Find the edge in one partition
00:53:53:8 Compare bits to find the edge
00:53:59:9 Wait finding outward edge isn't as trivial as I thought
00:54:44:4 Ok I think it works, have to analyze number of queries though
00:55:09:5 Coding it :)
01:11:53:2 Oops finding edge in one partition is flawed
01:13:10:9 Ok i think it will still work
01:19:04:0 Finished coding
01:21:52:1 Testing
01:29:38:8 Submitted pE
01:29:44:1 WA pre 2
01:29:48:1 Gonna write my own iteractor / checker
01:39:40:0 Found WA case
01:44:46:9 Submitting pE
01:44:50:0 Pre 3
01:45:00:0 WA 8
01:46:14:7 Submitting to check for invalid queries
01:53:20:0 Found bug type
01:54:22:9 WA 8 again?
SMH I'm dumb, I only messed up the last part of finding the odd cycle
