00:17:42:3 Submitted pB
00:17:55:5 AC pB pretests
00:18:03:5 Reading pC
00:18:55:7 pC is much simpler than pB, should've done it first :(
00:23:26:4 Submitted pC
00:23:56:4 AC pC pretests
00:24:06:3 Reading pD
00:26:24:3 Seems like simple dp, also simpler than pB :(
00:30:37:4 Submitting pD
00:30:45:6 WA test 3
00:31:12:2 The problem just randomly included the condition ai>0, and I missed that...
00:31:40:2 AC pD pretests
00:31:41:3 Reading pE
00:33:35:2 Is the answer to pE just the maximum number of bridges on a path?
00:34:28:9 The answer to pE seems to be the diameter of the bridge tree
00:34:38:0 Gonna write it
00:35:49:1 Gonna copy and paste bridge tree code from CEOI 2017 OneWay
00:41:18:2 Submitting pE
00:41:28:1 AC pE pretests
00:41:34:6 Reading pF
00:42:22:5 Strange memory limit for pF
00:43:37:2 It could be solved with Mo, but the TL is really tight for that
00:45:54:7 Wait it could be about 2D range queries
00:46:37:3 Screw this I'm writing Mo
00:46:53:9 Wait I'm going to do some research first
00:49:06:0 Not convinced that Mo will pass
00:56:15:8 Looking at the status, it looks like some people passed with Mo
00:56:44:9 Maybe I'll have to use more optimized IO
01:09:31:7 Finished writing, sample bugs
01:10:07:7 Submitting pF
01:10:28:1 Test 20
01:10:31:5 Test 27
01:10:34:6 Test 30
01:10:38:5 Test 33
01:10:48:3 Test 47
01:10:52:3 Test 49
01:11:01:7 Test 55
01:11:08:6 AC with 2s!!!
01:11:36:5 Should I try G?
01:11:40:2 No solves so far
01:13:25:1 Finished reading, it looks pretty hard
01:24:44:4 Doesn't look too hard now, but it has many cases
01:34:34:1 Starting to write
01:53:03:5 Finsihed coding?
01:57:52:9 Passed samples!!!
01:57:55:7 WA test 4
I just had to add a max() call to pG and it gets AC...
