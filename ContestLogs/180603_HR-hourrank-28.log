00:02:19:4 Finshed pA, reading B
00:05:33:3 Finally understand what B is asking, it's just bitmask dp but not so easy to implement
00:14:30:1 Submitting pB
00:14:39:5 Reading pC
00:15:25:5 AC pB
00:20:01:0 Just searched online, range xor updates and range sum queries can be answered with segment trees, but I'll just use square root decomposition
00:37:10:0 Finished implementing
00:37:42:5 Submitted
00:37:50:1 Rip TLE and WAs
00:42:49:0 Submitting again
00:45:04:6 And again
00:45:14:7 Looks like AC, maybe I would've been better off just writing segment tree?
