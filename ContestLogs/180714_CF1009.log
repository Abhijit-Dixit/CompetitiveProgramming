00:08:07:8 Hopefully pB passes
00:08:11:5 WA 4
00:19:14:7 Found bug, I had wrong greedy
00:19:18:6 Hopefully passes
00:19:27:7 Reading pC
00:26:59:2 Submitting pC
00:27:05:3 Reading pD
00:31:52:2 Could I just use brute for pD?
00:35:27:4 Testing maximum runtime with custom invocation
00:35:52:0 Submitting
00:35:54:9 WA 9
00:36:07:3 Oops, I didn't see that the create graph had to be connected
00:37:11:8 AC?
00:38:14:8 Read pF
00:41:10:3 Read pE
00:43:29:0 Found formulas for pE?
00:45:10:5 Starting to code
00:48:21:8 Submitting pE
00:48:58:5 Reading pG
00:53:39:3 pG feels like some sort of max flow
01:14:36:4 Idea for pF?
01:34:11:7 Submitting pF
01:34:43:3 Test 60
01:34:48:3 Looks like I don't need unordered_map for performance
01:36:56:2 Oh wait only 2^6 types of indices for pG, so max flow is kind of feasible
01:47:49:3 Praying that the constant factor will be low
01:50:37:0 Finished coding
01:51:47:7 Passes samples, submitting
01:53:17:2 Fk TLE
RIP max flow passes with a bit more optimizations, but the best solutions were simpler :(
pC ended up getting hacked, because of precision issues
