00:06:03:8 Finished pB
00:17:06:7 Finished pC
00:17:30:0 Reading pD
00:18:26:5 Thinking
00:20:54:2 Gonna write sketchy solution
00:23:44:8 Submitted pD
00:23:52:5 Reading pE
00:23:58:3 Fk geo
00:26:45:9 Reading pF
00:30:58:2 Find maximum sum of 2 edge disjoint paths in tree 1->u, n->v
00:33:15:0 pE has casework
00:48:24:0 Finished coding pE
00:53:32:6 Sample bugs
00:53:52:9 Submitting
00:54:16:1 Reading pG
00:54:53:7 AC pE?
00:55:48:0 pG seems impossible
00:56:46:1 Hmm for pF they can be intersecting
00:57:30:1 Find pair (i, j) such that min(1->i+n->j, 1->j+n->i) is maximal and i!=j
01:00:07:9 Seems very like tree dp
01:05:50:3 Case 1: change min edge from 1->n
01:29:56:6 Finished coding
01:33:09:1 TLE sample
01:42:31:9 Sht didn't see that the road can't be existing
