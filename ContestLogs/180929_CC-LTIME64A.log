00:21:35:6 Resubmitted "Chef Restaurant" with array instead of map
00:21:59:9 AC "Chef Restaurant"
00:23:02:2 n is even
00:23:05:7 Opposite city is just +n/2
00:24:31:5 Is ai=a(i+n/2)?
00:25:19:4 Yep
00:29:01:8 One solve for "Coin Partition"
00:29:04:5 Submitted "Opposite Cites"
00:29:37:4 "Match the Streams" seems to be segtree
00:29:41:4 AC "Opposite Cites"
00:35:51:9 Finished coding "Match the Streams"
00:38:35:7 submitting "Match the Streams"
00:38:45:0 Thinking "Coin Partition"
00:39:10:9 CE WTF
00:40:50:4 Bitset knapsack?
00:42:12:7 WA "Match the Streams"
00:43:27:4 Oops forgot to reset between tests
00:44:10:0 Submitting "Match the Streams"
00:44:52:4 TLE and RTE second subtask
00:51:13:3 Submitting "Match the Streams" with optimization
00:52:53:6 All TLE now
00:55:27:9 Reducing from log^2 to log with another segtree
01:04:00:5 Submitting "Match the Streams"
01:04:09:7 "Biased Judgement" now has more solves than "Coin Partition"
01:06:01:6 AC "Match the Streams"
01:06:07:7 "Biased Judgement" seems greedy
01:07:32:7 Eliminate tests that get WA
01:09:22:9 Sort tests by required TL?
01:11:30:0 Treat wrong answer as a time of INF
01:14:55:8 Process tests from least required TL
01:26:34:9 All AC/WA case
01:34:51:0 Submitted "Biased Judgement"
01:37:11:9 AC "Biased Judgement"
01:38:25:4 Chefu will have at most 500 more
01:40:18:4 Seems like simple knapsack
01:42:24:3 Wait a sec
01:57:10:1 Hmm don't have complete proof that v can be sorted
02:24:51:5 Submitting "Coin Partition"
02:26:53:8 AC "Coin Partition"
Map would've worked for "Chef Restaurant", CodeChef's servers were under high load
