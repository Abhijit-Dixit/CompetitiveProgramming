00:05:40:8 Submitted pA with binary search
00:05:51:4 AC pA?
00:06:56:0 Read pB
00:08:12:8 Read pC, looks like square root decomposition?
00:09:27:0 Or just number theory
00:11:15:0 GCD?
00:13:00:8 Submitting pC
00:13:11:7 Pretest 12
00:13:18:2 AC pC?
00:22:50:4 Submitting pB
00:22:56:0 WA 1
00:24:36:6 Submitting again, forgot query bound <=m
00:24:39:4 WA 1
00:25:18:0 Stupid typo, submitting again
00:25:33:3 AC pB?
00:25:41:8 Reading pD
00:26:56:7 Reading pE
00:29:02:6 pD looks like DP?
00:40:20:0 Finished coding pD
00:40:53:4 WA sample
00:43:10:7 Submitting pD
00:43:21:1 Pretest 9
00:43:33:1 Pretest 17
00:43:46:6 AC pD?
00:44:02:4 No solves for pE or pF
00:44:04:8 Reading pF
00:45:54:5 pF is a math problem :(
00:50:04:2 Determining if information is incorrect/correct is EZ, find minimum bounding cube of the "open" points
00:50:54:1 May have idea
00:51:04:0 3D sum queries D:
00:52:21:2 Sweeping merge sort tree?
00:53:10:4 Starting to code :/
01:07:16:3 Freak forgot how to write that tree, I'm just gonna use sweeping 2D fenwick tree
01:18:38:1 Finished coding
01:31:41:8 Submitting pE
01:31:48:6 Pretest 7
01:31:58:7 Pretest 10
01:32:00:7 Pretest 15
01:32:21:0 Ooh I see pA, pB, and pC getting hacked
01:32:24:5 AC pE?
