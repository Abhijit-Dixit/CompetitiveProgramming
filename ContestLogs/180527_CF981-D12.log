00:15:55:5 finished pA-pC
00:21:46:8 finished pD
00:22:24:0 pE is not that straightfoward
00:26:28:1 May have some bitset knapsack idea
00:42:44:9 AC pE?
00:43:34:2 pF looks interesting
00:44:36:9 pG also has a solve, so I'm going to read it
00:47:14:9 G seems doable?
01:15:25:7 RTE test 3
01:18:32:9 Didn't check for null stuff
01:18:48:0 WA test 3 :(
01:19:07:6 I see a lot of ppl failed test 3 too for pG
01:21:28:4 Going to stress test my solution
01:31:19:9 Found a case that fails
01:45:01:6 It seems to be an error with segment tree lazy propagation
01:45:09:2 Still WA 3
01:45:47:6 Found another test for which my solution fails
01:50:43:0 Don't want penalty, gonna stress test again before I submit
01:51:28:6 Pretests for pG passed with 2.5s... (out of 4s) I really don't want to rewrite in c++, hopefully it can pass systests
02:09:10:5 May have greedy idea for pF
02:32:45:0 Sample test cases finally passed
02:33:08:3 Pretests for pF passed!!! Just gonna do hacks now
