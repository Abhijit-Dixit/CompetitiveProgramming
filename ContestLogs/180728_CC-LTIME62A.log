00:00:29:2 Reading "MEX and Ranges"
00:01:14:7 Reading "Make a String"
00:02:39:0 Reading "GCD Sum"
00:03:11:7 Reading "Prime divisors"
00:04:11:7 Reading "Forced Particles"
00:05:54:2 They all look hard
00:06:09:6 Thinking "Prime divisors"
00:09:55:0 Thinking "MEX and Ranges"
00:10:33:0 Looks related to square root decomposition
00:12:51:8 "Prime divisors" has ACs, but I don't have any ideas for it
00:19:42:9 Fk it is simple
00:22:53:5 RTE sample
00:23:35:5 Submitting
00:23:46:1 Thinking "Forced Particles"
00:24:22:8 TLE???
00:25:38:7 Resubmitting with small optimization
00:26:40:2 WTF still TLE on the last test case
00:29:23:6 Added second small optimization
00:30:17:8 AC "Prime divisors", turns out modulo is a very expensive operation
00:30:21:6 Coding "Forced Particles"
00:33:49:0 Painful implementation
00:40:37:8 WA sample
00:41:57:6 Submitting
00:42:32:5 Ooh AC "Forced Particles"
00:42:45:0 "GCD Sum" doesn't look too hard now
00:45:00:0 Wait I only have O(2^n*m)
00:46:18:9 LOL the solution has nothing to do with 2^n
00:46:39:4 Wait now I have O(10^5*m)
00:47:18:8 NVM
00:54:01:1 WA sample
00:55:12:2 Submitting
00:55:49:2 "Make a String" really looks like DP
00:55:54:2 AC "GCD Sum"
01:01:02:2 Z-algorithm / prefix function will definitely be useful
01:01:19:6 2*10^8 operations seems a bit sketchy
01:01:35:2 Oh it's actually about 10^8
01:01:40:8 Yeah I'll try it
01:17:01:3 Finished coding
01:17:24:2 Sample bugs
01:28:21:3 Oops forgot to multiply |S| in the cost
01:28:52:0 Submitted
01:31:03:7 Still running :/
01:31:11:4 Gonna write brute force for "MEX and Ranges" subtask 1
01:31:41:3 Mostly WA
01:32:47:5 Time limit seems fine
01:33:28:9 Oh sht integer overflow
01:33:57:8 Submitting
01:36:40:7 WTF waited so long for CE
01:37:28:3 Submitted
01:40:19:2 AC "Make a String"
01:41:04:5 Submitting "MEX and Ranges" subtask 1
01:43:34:5 AC "MEX and Ranges" subtask 1
01:46:19:6 Finding number of unique elements in a range could be related to this
01:47:29:1 Sqrt decomposition?
01:47:35:6 With persistent segtree?
01:59:24:4 The sqrt*log factor is just too much for memory
01:59:25:9 And maybe time
02:07:12:9 Theres another solution with a sqrt factor for memory, but sqrt*log^2 for time :/
02:09:41:4 Oh NVM the memory is just as bad
02:45:35:9 Give up :D
02:58:56:3 Wait contest extension
03:14:45:2 Is there a geometric intrepretation with rectangles?
03:24:56:0 Submitting
03:26:39:4 WA
RIP contest is unrated
